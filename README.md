# Al-Hadi Association Webpage
## Author: **Hadi Ahmad**

This project was built with React to create a responsive and modern webpage for the Al-Hadi Association. While the initial template was sourced from loveable.dev, most of the design and development work was done by me. The webpage is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, serving as a digital presence for the association.

Features:
1. Responsive Design: The webpage adjusts to different screen sizes, using tailwind.css.
2. Smooth Navigation: With smooth scrolling and dynamic links, users can easily explore various sections of the site.
3. Custom Styling: Although based on the template from loveable.dev, I customized the styling and layout for the needs of the organization.

Technologies Used:
1. React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. CSS/HTML: For styling the webpage and making it visually appealing.
3. React Router: For smooth and dynamic page navigation.
4. ChatGPT: For making this README
